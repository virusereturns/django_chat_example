# django_chat_example

Very rudimentary example of a chat messages app using django-channels, possibly scalable with notifications or some other sort of things, but for now it'll serve as a nice starting point of what you can do with it, based off an Udemy tutorial by Ashutosh Pawar.

It's highly unfinished, to make the users you really need to create them with createsuperuser and login using the admin interface.

Same goes for creating the rooms, there are no user profiles so they have to be created by an admin user.

Some tailwind was used based on the tutorial and played around with different styles to practice using it a bit more.
